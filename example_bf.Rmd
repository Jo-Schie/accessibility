```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation
In order to use the package you need to have GRASS installed. For installation please refer to: https://grass.osgeo.org/download/. 

The easiest way to install the Accessibility package is using the *devtools* package.  The installation command should look like this: **devtools::install_github("s5joschi/accessibility")**.  Activate the library as usual before usage **library(AccessibilityMaps)**. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
